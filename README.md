## AI Features Setup (Optional)

To enable AI-powered features, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Choose your preferred AI provider
AI_PROVIDER=openai # or "google"

## How to implement in your project

### Installation

1. Copy the required folders to your project:

```
src/calendar/         # Core calendar functionality
src/components/ui/    # UI components used by the calendar
src/hooks/            # Required hooks like use-disclosure
```

2. Install dependencies missing in your project

### Basic setup

1. **Set up the `CalendarProvider`**

   Wrap your application or page with the `CalendarProvider`:

```tsx
import { CalendarProvider } from "@/calendar/contexts/calendar-context";

// Fetch your events and users data
const events = await getEvents();
const users = await getUsers();

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <CalendarProvider users={users} events={events}>
      {children}
    </CalendarProvider>
  );
}
```

2. **Add a `CalendarView`**

   Use the `ClientContainer` to render a specific view:

```tsx
import { ClientContainer } from "@/calendar/components/client-container";

export default function CalendarPage() {
  return <ClientContainer view="month" />;
}
```

### Views configuration

The calendar supports five different views, each can be used with the `ClientContainer` component:

```tsx
// Day view
<ClientContainer view="day" />

// Week view
<ClientContainer view="week" />

// Month view
<ClientContainer view="month" />

// Year view
<ClientContainer view="year" />

// Agenda view
<ClientContainer view="agenda" />
```

### Data structure

1. **Events Format**

   Events should follow this interface (you can modify it as you want, but the calendar will expect these fields):

```tsx
interface IEvent {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: string; // ISO string
  endDate: string; // ISO string
  color: "blue" | "green" | "red" | "yellow" | "purple" | "orange";
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}
```

2. **Users format**

   Users should follow this interface (you can modify it as you want, but the calendar will expect these fields):

```tsx
interface IUser {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  picturePath?: string; // Optional avatar image
}
```

### Customizing the calendar

1. **Badge Variants**

   You can control the event display style with the `ChangeBadgeVariantInput` component:

```tsx
import { ChangeBadgeVariantInput } from "@/calendar/components/change-badge-variant-input";

// Place this anywhere in your project tree inside the CalendarProvider
<ChangeBadgeVariantInput />;
```

2. **Creating events**

   Implement your own event creation by modifying the `onSubmit` handler in the `AddEventDialog` component.

### Using the Calendar Context

You can access and control the calendar state from any component using the `useCalendar` hook:

```tsx
import { useCalendar } from "@/calendar/contexts/calendar-context";

function MyComponent() {
  const { selectedDate, setSelectedDate, selectedUserId, setSelectedUserId, events, users, badgeVariant, setBadgeVariant } = useCalendar();

  // Your component logic
}
```

### Example implementation

```tsx
// pages/calendar.tsx
import { CalendarProvider } from "@/calendar/contexts/calendar-context";
import { ClientContainer } from "@/calendar/components/client-container";
import { ChangeBadgeVariantInput } from "@/calendar/components/change-badge-variant-input";

export default function CalendarPage({ events, users }) {
  return (
    <CalendarProvider events={events} users={users}>
      <div className="mx-auto flex max-w-screen-2xl flex-col gap-4 p-4">
        <ClientContainer view="month" />
        <ChangeBadgeVariantInput />
      </div>
    </CalendarProvider>
  );
}
```
